Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday released the long-awaited details of his tax refund plan to send $400 to Californians for each registered vehicle, a move that would put more money in the pockets of families who own more cars — even the state's highest-income residents — and exclude those without cars from receiving the payments.

Newsom's $11-billion proposal is designed to offset the rising prices consumers are paying at the pump and also includes savings for those who rely on public transportation. The plan would include $750 million in grants for free or substantially reduced public transit fare, but Californians who don't own a registered vehicle would otherwise not receive a refund.

The governor, who is up for reelection this year, would cap payments at $800 for any person with more than one vehicle registered under the person's name, though households with multiple vehicles registered to different family members could receive far more than that amount
