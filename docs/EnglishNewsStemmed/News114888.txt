breakingview - review: rockonom nice reflect the real world
pari (reuter breakingview) - on wai to understand the econom of rock and roll would be to comb through the breakingview archiv, read stori on the buyout of record compani, the rise and fall of file-share servic napster, industri experi by artist like radiohead and taylor swift, the boom in festiv and the emerg of stream servic. or you could just read “rockonom: a backstag tour of what the music industri can teach us about econom and life” by the late economist, alan krueger.
